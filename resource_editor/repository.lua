-- Never turned into a thing :(

-- I am not an active member of the MTA community anymore.
-- Rather I work in the GTA community in general as tool creator nowadays.
-- The MTA time was really fun tho so I decided to help out some guy that reached out to me.

-- MTA:Eir never turned into a thing, as I would have imagined it.
-- MTA:BLUE is still the same it ever was.
-- I don't know what to say, just to give a little of disappointment.

-- But I am happy that it is still a popular platform.
-- Have fun with this new resedit release!

-- Yours,
-- The_GTA / Martin Turski

-- Please check out Magic.TXD, by the way.
-- It is a great TXD editor made by DK22Pac and me!
